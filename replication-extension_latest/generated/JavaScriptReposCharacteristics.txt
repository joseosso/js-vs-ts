So that the processing of a single template doesn't care about what was there before, and the top loop adds in the previous funds instead of the previous funds being added during the processing.  I would have to check all the processing to make sure that setup doesn't break anything.\n\n### What error did you receive?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Where are you hosting Actual?\n\nNone\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\nNone",

If I add an await to the setZero call it works as expected, but I imagine that loses most of the speed gains.  I haven't looked into if the math could be changed to overcome this.\n\n### What error did you receive?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Where are you hosting Actual?\n\nNAS\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux",

Then in the terminal I navigated to that folder and pasted the git clone command. Following that I ran `yarn install`, which failed while building better-sqlite3:\r\n`➤ YN0009: │ better-sqlite3@npm:8.2.0 couldn't be built successfully (exit code 1, logs can be found here: /private/var/folders/rk/_hmpwzss0gn31q7g7667jmj40000gn/T/xfs-aa2b6d34/build.log)`\r\nAt the same time a new folder was created in my home directory named \"Actual\".

Choose this file: [polish-letters-repro.csv](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/files/11131125/polish-letters-repro.csv)\r\n6. Ensure CSV fields are properly matched, either of these configurations can be used for reproduction:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6032823/229330652-b92737db-1511-4af7-988a-245370c3f7c9.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6032823/229330666-8f098074-2d33-4842-8691-d10678bda843.png)\r\n7. After import, 4 transactions should be added:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6032823/229330822-af693309-d5ab-489b-b3f3-871aff05529e.png)\r\n8. Go to the rules page and start creating a new rule.\r\n9. Depending on what you chose in step 6, choose the \"imported payee\" or \"notes\" field.\r\n10. Use the \"contains\" matcher (this can be reproduced with \"is\" as well but you can test it more easily with \"contains\")\r\n11. Type in any single Polish letter: `ĄĆĘŁŃÓŚŹŻąćęłńóśźż`\r\n12. See only 2 transactions even though 4 should match. When you look closer, both of the matched transactions are the ones that don't start with a Polish letter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6032823/229330869-3e9ab9c7-3340-4b3c-a4c0-c1ca0c7afbd2.png)\r\n\n\n### What error did you receive?\n\nThe relevant transactions do not show up.\n\n### Where are you hosting Actual?\n\nFly.io\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux",

That did the trick.\r\n\r\nMy diagnosis is that `sql-lite3` version `^7.5.0` is not compatible with node@19.\r\n\r\nOne solution could be to upgrade it: it does look like [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3) on the latest version, `8.1.0`, installs just fine with the latest node! Unfortunately, there is no corresponding [@types/better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/better-sqlite3) package released yet. The latest one, `7.6.3` doesn't seem to be compatible with node@19 either :/\r\n\r\nMaybe, in the meantime, in package.json, we could set the engines node version to be up to node@18 for easier debugging?\r\n\r\n\r\n### What error did you receive?\r\n\r\nIn terminal after `yarn install`:\r\n```\r\n➤ YN0009: │ better-sqlite3@npm:7.6.2 couldn't be built successfully (exit code 1, logs can be found here: /private/var/folders/z0/3vjnzlg16dj160w2gtkbz4n40000gn/T/xfs-be73b5b6/build.log)\r\n➤ YN0000: └ Completed in 7s 532ms\r\n➤ YN0000: Failed with errors in 7s 767ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIn log file:\r\n```\r\n# This file contains the result of Yarn building a package (better-sqlite3@npm:7.6.2)\r\n# Script name: install\r\n\r\nprebuild-install warn install No prebuilt binaries found (target=19.7.0 runtime=node arch=arm64 libc= platform=darwin)\r\n\r\n> better-sqlite3@7.6.2 build-release /Users/<my_user>/Documents/code/actual-server/node_modules/better-sqlite3\r\n> node-gyp rebuild --release\r\n\r\nxcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/gyp_main.py\", line 16, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(gyp.script_main())\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/pylib/gyp/__init__.py\", line 545, in script_main\r\n    return main(sys.argv[1:])\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/pylib/gyp/__init__.py\", line 538, in main\r\n    return gyp_main(args)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/pylib/gyp/__init__.py\", line 523, in gyp_main\r\n    generator.GenerateOutput(flat_list, targets, data, params)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/pylib/gyp/generator/make.py\", line 2170, in GenerateOutput\r\n    part_of_all=qualified_target in needed_targets)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/pylib/gyp/generator/make.py\", line 766, in Write\r\n    extra_mac_bundle_resources, part_of_all)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/pylib/gyp/generator/make.py\", line 872, in WriteActions\r\n    env = self.GetSortedXcodeEnv()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/pylib/gyp/generator/make.py\", line 1851, in GetSortedXcodeEnv\r\n    additional_settings)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/pylib/gyp/xcode_emulation.py\", line 1584, in GetSortedXcodeEnv\r\n    additional_settings)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/pylib/gyp/xcode_emulation.py\", line 1495, in _GetXcodeEnv\r\n    if XcodeVersion() >= '0500' and not env.get('SDKROOT'):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/pylib/gyp/xcode_emulation.py\", line 1265, in XcodeVersion\r\n    version = re.match(r'(\\d\\.\\d\\.?\\d*)', version).groups()[0]\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'groups'\r\ngyp ERR! configure error \r\ngyp ERR! stack Error: `gyp` failed with exit code: 1\r\ngyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.onCpExit (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/lib/configure.js:305:16)\r\ngyp ERR! stack     at emitTwo (events.js:87:13)\r\ngyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:172:7)\r\ngyp ERR! stack     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:200:12)\r\ngyp ERR!

I'm self-hosting the Actual Docker image in a VM on my local network.\r\n\r\nI started testing Actual by forwarding port `5006` to my desktop.  I browsed to `http://localhost:5006` and created several budget Files in both Chrome and Firefox.  Things worked smoothly.  I was able to sync and see all File updates between Chrome and Firefox. \r\n\r\nSeeing this worked well, I wiped/restarted the Actual instance, and used the full URL to the Actual instance.  I started creating budget Files and found they were all getting merged together inconsistently.  I stopped, wiped/restarted the Actual instance again, flushed the entire cache in both Chrome and Firefox, and found the issue persisted.\r\n\r\nI also noticed Firefox showing `Error: Fallback mode unable to write file changes` in the dev console after I switched to the full URL.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I've successfully hosted several other containers/services using this same full URL which gives me a level of confidence in my DNS setup.\r\n\r\nI've done my best to document how to re-create this issue below.  \r\n\r\n### Hosting Setup\r\n- Self-hosted Ubuntu VM running Docker engine on my local network, no reverse-proxy or other redirection\r\n- Used Docker Compose to spin up Actual version `jlongster/actual-server:22.12.9` \r\n- Here is the `docker-compose.yaml` file I'm using:\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: '3.3'\r\nservices:\r\n  actual-server:\r\n    image: jlongster/actual-server:22.12.9\r\n    restart: always\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 5006:5006\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - data:/data\r\n\r\nvolumes:\r\n  data:\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Replicate Issue\r\n- Start with fresh Docker container\r\n```sh\r\ndocker compose down -v   # Ensures named volume is wiped\r\ndocker compose pull\r\ndocker compose up -d\r\n```\r\n\r\n- On Windows 10, using Chrome or Firefox, navigate to `http://<full URL>:5006`\r\n- Complete server setup, create budget Files with identifiable Account names and starting amounts\r\n- As you close each budget File, open the other ones, and see Accounts from other budget Files are showing up\r\n\r\n### Video 1\r\nServer setup using Chrome, creation of budget Files, and how the budgets appear \"merged.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122043098/211085705-9e1a9516-c10e-454a-a2c6-3f7b72b203b6.mp4\r\n\r\n### Video 2\r\nThe \"merged\" budgets appear the same in Firefox.  An additional budget File named `My Finance 2` is created to see if the merged issue persists back to Chrome.  **Note: merging is not consistent across all three budget Files.**  Firefox shows warning of budget being open in another tab (see screenshot of associated details below).\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122043098/211085825-2411a5d3-4d8e-4192-9b50-bb819fa8a66e.mp4\r\n\r\n### Screenshot of error in Firefox debug console\r\n![Screenshot 2023-01-06 143034](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122043098/211086863-50dbc45e-3d03-4cd9-8c76-d648aa7623fe.png)\r\n\r\n### Video 3\r\nShows the budget File `My Finance 2` is seen in Chrome and the merged issue is still present.  Opening `My Finance 2` causes several uncaught errors (see screenshot below).\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122043098/211085853-831803b3-f9ed-46be-90de-feec7c76a6e8.mp4\r\n\r\n### Screenshot of uncaught error in Chrome debug console\r\n![Screenshot 2023-01-06 140341](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122043098/211086066-73ef62e4-d97f-43a1-92c7-bebf849852a5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What error did you receive?\r\n\r\nBudget Files appear to be merged when created and opened using full URL to Actual instance.  This issue was present for both Chrome and Firefox on Windows 10.\r\n\r\n### Additionally\r\n- Firefox showed several `Error: Fallback mode unable to write file changes`  when accessing each budget for the *first time* using the full URL\r\n- Chrome showed several `Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'prepare')` upon opening `My Finance 2`\r\n\r\n### Where are you hosting Actual?\r\n\r\nDocker\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nFirefox, Chrome\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nWindows 10",

I understand that someone here is working on a responsive web app. I understand that this will work much better for 99% of people who are wanting to just use actual and who are selfhosting the server.\r\n\r\nBut,\r\n\r\nSome of us (or at least me) want to learn how to make offline-first apps for iOS and see an actual working product that we can then mess around with and use as a base to make other offline-first apps. And along the way, if I happened to be able to use actual as an app on my iPhone, that would be great too.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm not asking for support for a non-supported feature. But there are missing files in the iOS/xcode project, and it so doesn't build. Is there some chance these files could be added to the open source repository? Or that some pointer could be given as to how to get it to build?\r\n\r\nI'm happy to hack away at it on my own, but I don't know enough about iOS development to get it to work without the missing files--or maybe I'm just missing something and that's why it won't build.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else gotten the iOS app to build?\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n### What error did you receive?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Where are you hosting Actual?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_",

This seems to be a fork of `react-dev-utils` which is maintained by @jlongster.\r\n\r\nIn order to update the codebase to use TS we need a TS compatible linter (#110), swapping out babel for tslint's parser as otherwise the linter will error on any .ts files.\r\n\r\nThe issue with this however is we need to update eslint as we're using a version released in 2018 whereas [v1.0.0 of typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/releases/tag/v1.0.0) was released in 2019. Updating `eslint` causes incompatibilities with `eslint-loader`, and in turn updating that causes incompatibilities with `jwl-dev-utils`.\r\n\r\n`jwl-dev-utils` has had a number of patches applied relative to `react-dev-utils` (but these patches don't seem to have been pushed to github). This means that it's hard to know exactly what code is running and how it's different from `react-dev-utils`. Not knowing how the code differs from `react-dev-utils` makes it difficult to easily rollback to the official version of `react-dev-utils` so we can start migrating forwards to more recent versions (builds start failing when replacing it with the most similar version of `react-dev-utils`).\r\n\r\n@jlongster could you publish what these changes are and potentially help with updating these dependencies as this seems to be a blocker for many priorities and there's info about this which only you can provide?",

                        "description": "I'm leaving this comment as it is for the record but I've made a new list as a fresh comment below.\r\n----\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in Discord, here's general rundown of my PRs. I've arranged them in an order which seems logical in terms of priorities and should minimise merge conflicts. I haven't considered how any of the other PRs should factor into this.\r\n\r\n## 1. Trivial changes\r\n\r\nMostly stuff which doesn't touch the core code at all but tidies up the repo:\r\n\r\n#46 reorders the dependencies in the package.json files into alphabetical order, yarn does this automatically when installing new dependencies so this means other PRs which do this have less noisy diffs.\r\n#54 updates the links in the importer packages so that they point at this repo.\r\n#47 adds a missing comma to make `jest.config.js` valid JS.\r\n#48 cleans up some files which don't seem to be used and were committed by mistake.\r\n#69 enforces the sorting of entries in `data-file-index.txt` as I get a different order to what's committed.\r\n#81 removes some yarn scripts which point at nothing so always fail.\r\n#80 creates yarn scripts for `desktop-electron` package to simplify `bin/package` (useful if we upgrade to yarn v3)\r\n#96 whitespace changes to the CI config\r\n\r\n## 2. Documentation\r\n\r\nNo significant code changes, just writing READMEs:\r\n\r\n#65 adds documentation for how to generate the protobuf.\r\n\r\n## 3. CI\r\n\r\n### 3.1 Laying groundwork\r\nBefore we can set up CI we need to do a couple of fixes so that we can install dependencies in CI without it failing:\r\n\r\n#53 Removes an unused patch which causes `yarn install` to fail in CI.\r\n#55 Locks the dependency versions of patched packages so that we always install the patched version (a mismatch causes `yarn install` to fail in CI)\r\n- Alternatively we can merge #89 to update the patches to match the versions currently being installed.\r\n\r\n### 3.2 Checking builds succeed\r\n\r\nI've got some branches which work on migrating us up to [Webpack 5 and `swc-loader`](https://github.com/TomAFrench/actual/pull/3) but I think we need some CI to test all the different builds we do first:\r\n\r\n#72 Updates the shebang in some scripts so it uses `bash` instead of `sh`. We're using bash features in these scripts so they're failing on my machine and CI with `sh`.\r\n#73 Adds a github action CI to check that we can build all the various outputs on any PR.\r\n\r\n### 3.3 Linter checks\r\n\r\n#70 Adds a github action CI to check for any linter errors in `loot-core`\r\n\r\n## 4 Fixes\r\n\r\n#59 Fixes the broken Timestamp test suite and updates the `Timestamp` implementation to enforce the proper validity checks.\r\n#102 Fixes a broken test by scaling up some values so they're all integers.\r\n\r\n## 5 Reorganising code\r\n\r\nThese shouldn't change functionality at all, I'm mostly just moving code around so that it's easier to read/import:\r\n\r\n#64 Group `timestamp.js` and `merkle.js` into a `crdt` directory as they're intrinsically linked.\r\n#68 Create a single entrypoint for importing AQL code rather than reaching into multiple different files in the `aql` directory\r\n#83 Breaks the functions contained in `db/index` up into multiple files based on which sort of data they're working on.\r\n\r\n## 6 Migration to typescript\r\n\r\nThese PRs are going to muck with CI and have a bunch of merge conflicts with the PRs above. I can rebase these on top of master once we get closer to the point of merging.\r\n\r\n### 6.1 Migrate to Yarn v3\r\n\r\nThis isn't necessarily a hard requirement for migrating to typescript but it definitely simplifies it. Running tests in a monorepo is much simpler in yarn v3 so I'd strongly recommend making this change so we can get rid of some of the hacks around testing.\r\n\r\n#50 Upgrades from yarn v1 to yarn v3\r\n\r\n### 6.1 Migrate tests\r\n\r\nBefore we can migrate the code, we need to migrate how we run the tests. Otherwise we end up trying to import Typescript code and then jest doesn't know what to do with it. If we swap out `babel-jest` for `ts-jest` the tests run fine without any modification and will still work once we add typescript to the mix.\r\n\r\nI'm not making a PR for this just yet as the diff is so noisy with required prerequisite changes that it's not really worth looking at yet. The relevant commit however is https://github.com/TomAFrench/actual/commit/28056eae687850e2b44fa3248bb16784005acd3a\r\n\r\n### 6.2 Migrate loot-core\r\n\r\nAt this point we're now ready to start using Typescript code so we can add TS support to Webpack. This PR currently uses yarn v1 and will need to be rebased on top of #50 at some point before we merge.\r\n\r\nThe code is still 99.99% javascript after this but this allows us to progressively migrate files over time:\r\n\r\n#84 Adds support for Webpack to use .ts files in the build and swaps out linter for a TS compatible one.",

Are these tests currently expected to fail or is this an artifact of code being copied over into the monorepo where some initialisation of the config is missing?\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, could you set up circleCI to start tracking this repo?\r\n",

                        "description": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a request for comment (RFC) on if client-side encryption should be sunset in Actual OSS. \r\n\r\nActual clients support syncing between many instances using a centralized server (sync server). As clients make modifications, the changes to their internal state are set to the sync server to be received and applied by other individual client instances.\r\n\r\nFurther, under Actual (in the before times), the client supported encrypting all data locally before the data was sent to the sync server, as documented [here (end-to-end-encryption)](https://actualbudget.com/docs/overview/syncing-across-devices/#end-to-end-encryption).\r\n\r\nEffectively, client side encryption allows for a zero-trust model for the syncing server. The end-user could assume both the data was encrypted on disk in a format that even the operator of the server would not be able to access.\r\n\r\n### Terminology\r\n\r\nWhen I refer to the sync server, I refer to a hypothetical server that only handles syncing of encrypted data between clients. The OSS server is functionally different from the previous implementation.\r\n\r\nWhen I refer to a client, I refer to the full-fat clients in the model of the before times Actual e.g. the Mobile client and the Electron Desktop client. The OSS server blurs the lines.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nIn Actual OSS, servers are hosted and maintained by the same individuals using the Actual OSS client. These individuals may employ full-disk encryption or other security measures if they believe such protections are warranted. Since there is no longer a third-party operator who may have access to the Actual data, the zero-trust model is less useful.\r\n\r\nClient-side encryption should be considered for removal from Actual OSS.\r\n\r\n### Pro Removal\r\n\r\n- The original security concerns are moved to individuals, allowing them to choose their threat model. \r\n- Not only is this client-encryption less useful, the encryption introduces additional complexities:\r\n  - Additional error checking is required.\r\n  - Additional API surface area needs to be maintain.\r\n  - Multiple logic flows (encrypted and unencrypted) would need to be tested and maintained.\r\n  - The server is unable to modify the Actual data without the involvement from a client. This may make largely desired features, such as automatic bank import, more difficult.\r\n  - etc.\r\n- Encryption is currently not supported by the OSS server per this comment: https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server/blob/44d045f546ceb2440f2a681bc5821bbb8eefb80f/app-sync.js#L126-L135 Additional work will be required to support client-side encryption.\r\n\r\n### Against Removal\r\n\r\n- Some individuals may not have the technical ability to secure a server effectively (e.g. full disk encryption is only useful with physically protected, physical hardware, which may be out of scope for many). Services like https://fly.io/ should be considered as the lowest common denominator that should still support a secure encryption model.\r\n- Client side encryption is a features that is best added at the beginning of development. The code largely already exists and should be maintained.\r\n- If a community maintained cloud service is every considered again (similar to https://www.home-assistant.io/cloud/), client-side encryption would be largely desirable. \r\n\r\n## Commentary\r\n\r\n- I personally found this client-side encryption feature a major factor in ultimately selecting Actual for personal use. I still believe client-side encryption is a killer feature.\r\n- I personally run full-disk encryption on my own infrastructure, and while I support the inclusion of any time of client-side encryption (and would actively use it), the developer side of me likes the idea of being able to modify Actual data from the server without a client (aka a developer API). I would want to prioritize features like Plaid fetching or stock value tracking over client-side encryption - as I personally can secure the Actual data in a way that is acceptable.\r\n",

This migration could also be accomplished with an update to the desktop app to allow it to point at any server, but either way I think uploading actual files just makes sense.\r\n\r\nThis would also allow for storing the exported .zip as a backup while managing the server, which I believe is also needed.",

Just have found a recurring bug that makes scheduling transactions a bit of a pain.\r\n\r\nAs of now, I can't just type the payee (or create a new one), hit tab, and have that payee updated. I have to specifically click on the payee. Here is an example via creating a new payee, but this is also the case for existing payees.\r\n\r\nFirst, I type in the payee I want. Right now, this is prompting me to create a new payee.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24489520/143927966-b1247936-08d6-41cc-a6cf-07eb5bc97936.png)\r\n\r\nThen I hit tab. Intuitively, hitting tab is to select that option and then go to the next row. But as you can see, not only is no payee entered, but the payee actually is not created. Like I said, existing payees don't get selected either.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24489520/143928040-a47f82ed-5805-40e8-8383-2cebf93563d0.png)\r\n\r\nI can only move forward if I click the payee I want (or click \"make new\").\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24489520/143928216-e291cd5f-a815-4b96-b191-a2abd77dd924.png)\r\n\r\nThanks so much!",

For example, in the Schedules view I'd like to move the Date and Status columns all the way to the left. In Accounts, I would like to move the Category column before the Notes column. That would be more intuitive and easier to glance through for me, but some people might like it in another order.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this could be part of the table rewrite you mentioned? @jlongster in https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues/328",

I seem to be having an issue with metadata parsing though.\r\n\r\nI've been poking around your code with ChatGPT and I think I've noticed that you're parsing the png metadata to get the prompt and image generation parameters. I don't have that enabled on my A1111 install. Instead, I have it output the metadata as a txt file of the same name as the picture. \r\n\r\nHere's an example of the formatting:\r\n\r\n```\r\na picture of 6 cats doing backflips while making waffles\r\nNegative prompt: lowres, bad anatomy, hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low normal jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry, out of focus\r\nSteps: 18, Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras, CFG scale: 12.5, Seed: 1491956809, Face restoration: CodeFormer, Size: 768x512, Hypernet: charTurner, Hypernet hash: e3b0c442, Batch size: 2, Batch pos: 0, Denoising strength: 0.78, Mask blur: 4\r\n```\r\nand the picture/file naming scheme is\r\n\r\n```\r\n1664914851512-1491956809.png\r\n1664914851512-1491956809.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this is the script that needs to be altered.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cocktailpeanut/breadboard/blob/f2aa1514a341581e68ff66c16a54f0034f5e4802/crawler/parser.js#L4-L24\r\n\r\nBut I'm horrid at javascript. \r\nChatGPT suggested adding this, but I haven't tried it yet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconvert(e, options, pictureName) {\r\n  // code here\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  // Get the name of the text file by replacing the extension of the picture name with .txt\r\n  let textFileName = pictureName.replace(/\\.[^/.]+$/, \".txt\");\r\n\r\n  // Read the contents of the text file\r\n  let textFileContents = fs.readFileSync(textFileName, \"utf8\");\r\n\r\n  // Parse the contents of the text file as JSON\r\n  let metadata = JSON.parse(textFileContents);\r\n\r\n  // Use the metadata from the text file to populate the x object\r\n  // code here\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll probably poke around at it in the next day or two. Figured I'd make an issue in case it's easy to change. I also might be entirely wrong. haha.\r\n\r\nI'm also having an issue with large amounts of files (around 40,000 pictures) not displaying correctly, but I'll see if I can look into that too (don't hold your breath lol).",

Currently though breadboard only displays the model name, which is frequently not even included in the metadata (at least my default setup of automatic1111 does not include model name). But model hash is almost always present in the metadata, so breadboard should display it and also allow search and navigation by hash.\r\n\r\nIf you need to save space in breadboard's metadata display I think it would be OK to combine model name and hash on the same line, like this:\r\n\r\nmodel_name:\tHassanBlend1.4 (4cf12f5d)\r\n",

This is a bad design because it contains both the file metadata table as well as user specific data (such as favorites, settings, etc.). In this version, The db has been separated into 2: \"data\" database and \"user\" database. The \"data\" database simply stores the file metadata, and it's totally fine if the entire database gets corrupted or deleted because breadboard can always recrawl from the files. The \"user\" database includes all the user specific data that cannot be retrieved from files, such as favorites table, checkpoints table, folders table, and settings table. This makes it much easier to upgrade the schema and also makes the database portable and exportable.\n2. Global Queries: You can now set ANY favorited query as \"global\", and this query will be automatically applied to every query by default (in the background). For example if you set \"-tag:nsfw\" and \"-file_path:txt2img-grids\" as global queries, when you enter 'cat', the search bar will only display \"cat\", but the search result will return the same result as \"cat -tag:nsfw -file_path:txt2img-grids\"\n3.

If you are already logged in to PiHole in another browser tab, you can still call the API this way, but for a call without login another solution is used now (correct me if I'm wrong) \r\n\r\n\r\nIf I'm right, the API is now called like this: `/admin/api.php/?summary&auth=APITOKEN` .\r\n\r\nTherefore I have adapted the call in the file `code.js` under `/app/apps/Smart/Pi-Hole` accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf I now try the call via Fenrus again, an error still appears.\r\nMaybe it is because of the different JSON formatting? (see picture 1 and picture 2) \r\n\r\nPicture 1 (API Call per `/summary/&auth=APITOKEN`)\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113239463/216769743-b12bb5f7-7cd3-4b0c-941e-68d261b9ecfd.png)\r\n\r\nPicture 2 (API call per `/api.php`, but with login before on another browser tab)\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113239463/216769801-70128bcb-29d9-418b-b54e-2157538c9be4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I test it, \"test result false\" appears in the logs .\r\n\r\nAfter saving then later in the logs appears:\r\n\r\n`13:56:23.146error in app: Pi-hole TypeError: percent.toFixed is not a function`\r\n\r\n    `at PiHole.status (/app/apps/Smart/Pi-hole/code.js:23:33)\r\n\r\n    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)\r\n\r\n    at async AppRouter.getStatus (/app/routes/AppRouter.js:154:26)\r\n\r\n    at async AppRouter.safeAsync (/app/routes/FenrusRouter.js:28:13)\r\n\r\n    at async /app/routes/AppRouter.js:37:69` \r\n",

However, the uv.handler does not assign a value to __uv.db, so it is always undefined and cannot be written into idb. Changing it to await __uv.cookie.db() allows writing into idb.\r\n```\r\n client.document.on('setCookie', async (event) => {\r\n        Promise.resolve(\r\n            __uv.cookie.setCookies(\r\n                event.data.value,\r\n                await __uv.cookie.db(),\r\n                __uv.meta\r\n            )\r\n        ).then(() => {\r\n            __uv.cookie.db().then((db) => {\r\n                __uv.cookie.getCookies(db).then((cookies) => {\r\n                    cookieStr = __uv.cookie.serialize(cookies, __uv.meta, true);\r\n                });\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n        const cookie = __uv.cookie.setCookie(event.data.value)[0];\r\n\r\n        if (!cookie.path) cookie.path = '/';\r\n        if (!cookie.domain) cookie.domain = __uv.meta.url.hostname;\r\n\r\n        if (__uv.cookie.validateCookie(cookie, __uv.meta, true)) {\r\n            if (cookieStr.length) cookieStr += '; ';\r\n            cookieStr += `${cookie.name}=${cookie.value}`;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        event.respondWith(event.data.value);\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nThe following code is to store cookies from different websites in separate IDBs, and everything seems fine.\r\nhttps://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet/blob/3f920ee7b4ac35b429a7fa9c38baaec1615e2b1f/src/uv.handler.js#L413-L415\r\nBut when uv.sw.js processes the injected cookie information in the HTML header, it does not modify the name of idb. Therefore, only the cookie of _op database can be retrieved here instead of the proxy website's cookie, which causes a bug.\r\nhttps://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet/blob/3f920ee7b4ac35b429a7fa9c38baaec1615e2b1f/src/uv.sw.js#L108-L113\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, I had to comment out the code that modifies the IDB database name. This way, all cookies are saved in the _op database and now it seems to be working fine.\r\n```\r\n  client.idb.on('idbFactoryOpen', () => {\r\n        //event.data.name = `${__uv.meta.url.origin}@${event.data.name}`;\r\n    });\r\n```",

I'm writting a tiny site generator with the most basic templating possible. This will require restructuring of the site/ folder hierarchy.\r\n\r\n- `site/data`: the new location of `momentum-cart.json`. We may want to add default carts or other data in the future.\r\n- `site/js`: vendored third party JS dependencies, e.g. AlaSQL and Chart.js\r\n- `site/`: `.html` and `.js` files for each page of the site. Also contains files beginning with an `_`, like `_header.html`.\r\n\r\nThe  generator is given the `site/` directory as an input directory, and an arbitrary output directory. It will then:\r\n\r\n1. For each file in the input directory recursively\r\n    1. If the file starts with `_`, ignore it\r\n    1. Load the content of the file and replace any occurance of `%%$filename%%` with the contents of `$filename`. The `$filename` is given relative to the currently processed file\r\n    1. Write the content to the output directory\r\n\r\nThe generator is called both by `server.js` (previously `index.js`) and `pages.js`. The server will also watch the input directory for changes and regenerate the output accordingly. The `latest-canonical.${store}.compressedjson` files will be directly written to the output directory.\r\n\r\nNo, I do not want to use a pre-existing \"solution\". There's nothing as lightweight out there.\r\n\r\nRFC @iantsch @mhochsteger @simmac @pretzelhands @slhck before I fuck shit up.\r\n",

Automating this steps is quite easy (and no need to certify executables etc., but larger release size (30mb in my test) )\r\n\r\nTo install it, you just need to download and extract a zip file, and double-click `run.bat`\r\n\r\nI did test this on Windows with the following code: https://github.com/mhochsteger/heissepreise/tree/local_deployment\r\nOnly two changes needed: Path fixes (`path.sep` instead of `/`), host `site` as static directory (no separate web server)\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n- How to do updates? (use node script to check for and download source release from github?) \r\n- Any plans on an Android app? (that would be an even greater boost, but I have no expertise here)",

It would be very nice if one could search for units properly. You can currently enter a number as part of the search query, but it's not always effective enough.\r\n\r\nI can have a look at the raw data processing when I have time. I guess the first step is to have some proper quantity in the canonical data, like\r\n```json\r\n\"quantity\": 125,\r\n\"unit\": \"g\"\r\n```\r\ninstead of \r\n` \"unit\": \"125 Gramm Packung\"\r\n`\r\n\r\nTo keep it simple, I would convert the canonical data into either \"g\" and \"ml\". From that you can easily derive \"Euro/kg\" etc. and sort by unit price.",

Go to the examples page https://swiffyslider.com/examples/\r\n2. Reduce the browser view to a mobile size (**less than** 990px wide)\r\n3.

But it requires node environment and I can't add it to windows autostart (and also obligated to have console window all the time). You may have other reasons to have prebuilt binaries, but whatever\r\n\r\n1. Install `esbuild` and `pkg`:\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i -g esbuild pkg\r\n```\r\n2. Wrap that async statement in async function and call it\r\n```diff\r\n\r\nimport * as Bridge from './bridge.js';\r\nimport Server from './server.js';\r\n\r\n- const server = await new Server();\r\n\r\n- server.on('activity', data => Bridge.send(data));\r\n+ async function main() {\r\n+     const server = await new Server();\r\n+     server.on('activity', data => Bridge.send(data));\r\n+ }\r\n\r\n+ main();\r\n```\r\n3. Bundle to single file via esbuild (node ≤ 18, node19 is not supported yet by `pkg`):\r\n```bash\r\nesbuild --bundle --platform=node --target=node18 --outdir=dist .\\src\\index.js\r\n```\r\n4. Build executable:\r\n```bash\r\npkg -t node18-win-x64 -o arrpc  .\\dist\\index.js #Windows amd64,  Node 18.x\r\npkg -t node18-linux-x64 -o arrpc  .\\dist\\index.js #Linux amd64, Node 18.x\r\npkg -t node18-macos-x64 -o arrpc  .\\dist\\index.js #MacOS amd64, Node 18.x\r\n```\r\n5.

                        "description": "Great extension! I LOVE IT.\r\n\r\nOne thing I've noticed though: in my [website](https://martyr.shop/) I have a dark mode switch. I'm gonna use it to describe the behavior I'm experiencing.\r\n\r\nA little background: my system, Firefox and the extension are working on dark mode right now (it's night time here at the moment of testing the extension). I have the Dark Reader extension installed, but I disabled it completely from Firefox extensions to track down the problem properly.\r\n\r\nI got 2 problems:\r\n\r\n- When I'm in dark mode in the website, everything works fine. However, if switch to the light theme, it doesn't change the tab colors right away. I need to refresh or get into a link to make it change.\r\n- If I leave it in light mode, it flashes in dark and then goes to the proper color again (light).\r\n\r\nI can tell you that the meta `theme-color` in my website is set via javascript at the very beginning of loading the website. The flashing problem does not happen in Chrome or similar browsers in Android where the tabs color changes according to the current webpage theme, and they switch dynamically as well. \r\n\r\nI could say that the flashing problem might be because the `theme-color` tag is being processed a few milliseconds late, but still the javascript code is running even before the DOM is processed I guess. The problem does not happen in Android browsers because they process the `theme-color` tag a bit late and, in the meantime they retain the previous color, I guess?\r\n\r\nEDIT: the flash issue seems to happen, at least to me, in the [homepage](https://martyr.shop/), [here](https://martyr.shop/collections/all), and any product page. It does not happen, however, [here](https://martyr.shop/pages/faq), or at least not so frequently, which may hint a race condition problem as I mentioned. \r\n\r\nAnd an optional issue, which I don't really know if that's part of the scope of what the extension is able to do:\r\n\r\n- The SVG favicon in my webpage is able to switch between dark and light mode depending on the system color scheme (I'm guessing more precisely Firefox color scheme). So, it won't change according to the current theme chosen in the website, which is desirable given that it has to go along the color scheme of the whole browser. Thing is, the extension does change the whole look of the borders and tabs. \r\n\r\nDoes it have the ability to switch the SVG colors in the favicons? To give more information, SVG uses the media query `(prefers-color-scheme: dark)` to change the `fill` color within the icon. It is embedded in the SVG file.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Can be `legacy` or `notarytool`. `notarytool` is substantially (10x) faster.\r\n\r\nSince [this project does not set the `tool` option](https://github.com/arduino/lab-micropython-editor/blob/1d87f82f3c9c24409ba831ba3720bd68a39639fa/build_resources/notarize.js#L37-L42), it is using the default `legacy`.\r\n\r\nUsing **altool** for notarization is now deprecated and is scheduled to be disabled 2023-11-01:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/news/?id=y5mjxqmn\r\n\r\nEven though it is not immediately necessary to make this change, there is no technical reason to wait until the last minute to make the switch to **notarytool**. Doing so sooner would allow the migration to be done in a calm manner and with the option of temporarily reverting the build system back to using **altool** if some problem was identified during the migration. In addition, the claim is that the system will be significantly more efficient with **notarytool** so the migration has benefits beyond simply avoiding the breakage in November.",

It was just recently that I found out reading the contents of a script called `pyboard.py` to investigate better ways to do it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# pyboard.py\r\n# This file is part of the MicroPython project, http://micropython.org/\r\n#\r\n# The MIT License (MIT)\r\n#\r\n# Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Damien P.

                        "description": "I'm not sure if I have missed something since the documentation is very limited up to now. I would consider it one of the most important features of a tool like dataplane to not only create nodes once (e.g. a python code block) but being able to reuse this node in other pipelines as well. \r\nTo do that, we would need something like a central library to look for existing nodes so that you could drag&drop them into your pipeline in the same way as you do it for processors right now, but instead of being empty or with the default \"print(\"Node-ID\")\" statements it would contain the code that was already written in another pipeline.\r\nIdeally, you would also have some git integration for that, because if you write a significant amount of code, you surely want it to be versioned. Presumably, you could simulate that by running a bash script to clone a git repository and execute it, but than you loose the advantage of the built-in editor. ",

                        "description": "Hi, first of all, let me thank you for this amazing tool. It is the only one I have seen so far that is able to download an entire account without missing a single video and without watermark.\r\n\r\nI just have one issue with it : the files downloaded don't have the video ID in the filename. This is important to me because every other tool I have used so far puts the video ID in the filename (sometimes they add stuff like \"Date-VideoID\" or \"AccountName-VideoID\" but that's easy to rename en masse). This means that videos downloaded with your tool would be really hard to organize in the long term.\r\n\r\nTo be clear with what I mean by \"video ID\", for example : with this url https://www.tiktok.com/@natgeo/video/7203786116573498666 , the video ID would be 7203786116573498666 .\r\n\r\nI know that in the \"Features to be implemented\" you wrote \"Allow user to select filename template\". This would be a really awesome addition. Do you have an estimate for when you might add this in a release ?\r\n\r\nIf this isn't planned to be released soon, could you walk me through how to edit the code to include the video ID in the filename ?\r\nI imagine it has to do with the highlighted line in this screenshot, but my coding skills are very poor and I didn't manage to edit in any way that didn't breaking the program.\r\n![filename](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123712415/221682290-7b050200-a951-482b-948f-ad234dbbc8f1.PNG)\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you so much for this program. And thank you for the english translations. Your english is much better than my chinese would be so I sticked to it to ask you for help :)",

In my theme app extension, I make a POST request to my server, but I don't see the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the tutorial, this is how the server middleware was applied.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  applyPublicEndpoints(app);\r\n\r\n  // All endpoints after this point will require an active session\r\n  app.use(\r\n    '/api/*',\r\n    verifyRequest(app, {\r\n      billing: billingSettings,\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  // All endpoints after this point will have access to a request.body\r\n  // attribute, as a result of the express.json() middleware\r\n  app.use(express.json());\r\n  applyPrivateEndpoints(app);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I need to be able to make a post request from the embedded app I'm working on. So I moved the express.json call above my public middleware like so. \r\n```\r\n  // All endpoints after this point will have access to a request.body\r\n  // attribute, as a result of the express.json() middleware\r\n  app.use(express.json());\r\n  applyPublicEndpoints(app);\r\n\r\n  // All endpoints after this point will require an active session\r\n  app.use(\r\n    '/api/*',\r\n    verifyRequest(app, {\r\n      billing: billingSettings,\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n  applyPrivateEndpoints(app);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I'm still unable to access the request body. It simply shows an empty object. I'm not if this is an expressjs issue or if there's a Shopify specific something I'm missing. Any help is appreciated.",

Currently, the data validation process is not functioning correctly, and there are issues with sending messages through the backend.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 1945-03-03 at 12 11 04 AM](https://github.com/amupedia2021/Project-Amupedia/assets/94748228/197ed8ab-dadd-4856-ad9a-9bdefecd5852)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Context:\r\nThe Contact Us section is crucial for users to reach out and communicate with our team. However, the existing bugs in data validation and backend functionality hinder users from successfully submitting their messages and receiving timely responses. Resolving these issues is vital to maintain effective communication with our users.\r\n\r\nThis change is important to me as it ensures a seamless user experience and allows us to address user inquiries and concerns promptly. By fixing the data validation and backend issues, we can restore the functionality of the Contact Us section and provide reliable communication channels for our users.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution:\r\n\r\n1. Review the code responsible for data validation in the Contact Us form to identify the specific bugs causing the issues.\r\n2. Debug and fix the data validation logic to ensure that all required fields are properly validated and any invalid input is flagged.\r\n3. Inspect the backend infrastructure and API endpoints used for sending messages from the Contact Us form.\r\n4. Identify and resolve any issues related to sending messages through the backend, such as misconfigured API endpoints or errors in message transmission.\r\n5. Perform thorough testing to verify that the Contact Us form is functioning correctly, both in terms of data validation and successful message delivery.\r\n\r\n## Additional Information:\r\nPlease assign this issue to me under GSSoC '23 so that I can start working on it.\r\n",

It enhances the onboarding experience by creating a welcoming atmosphere and offers automated acknowledgment in case no one is available to reply. It ensures that newcomers receive guidance and assistance even in the absence of immediate human interaction.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n1. Personalized Greetings: Delivers tailored greetings based on user information, fostering a friendly and engaging environment.\r\n2. Automated Acknowledgment: If no one is available to reply or acknowledge the greeting, the bot provides predefined responses, ensuring users feel acknowledged and supported.\r\n3. Welcome Message and Resources: Provides a comprehensive welcome message, including links to relevant resources, guidelines, and documentation to help users get started.\r\n4. Multi-platform Integration: Seamlessly integrates with GitHub repositories, extending greetings and support across various platforms, such as websites, mobile apps, and social media.\r\n5. Customizable Settings: Offers flexibility in customizing the bot's behavior, allowing repository owners to define fallback responses, timing intervals, and other parameters as per their specific needs.\r\n\r\nBy implementing the Greeting Bot for GitHub with automated acknowledgment, repositories can ensure that new users receive a warm welcome and valuable information, fostering a positive onboarding experience, even when immediate human interaction may not be possible.\n\n### Add ScreenShots\n\n![image](https://github.com/MonalikaPatnaik/UMatter/assets/96341431/fda73981-0131-458b-8044-a5a4b173ce5b)\r\n\n\n### Record\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n- [X] I'm a GSSOC'23 contributor\n- [X] I want to work on this issue",

This is because the `title` attribute is intended to provide additional information to screen reader users.\r\n\r\n- The `aria-label` attribute is a way more important for providing accessibility information to screen reader users. The `aria-label` attribute is an Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attribute that can be used to provide a label for an element. This label is then read aloud by screen readers, providing additional information about the element to the user.\r\n\r\n- In general, the `aria-label` & `title` attributes are preferred for providing accessibility information to screen reader users.\r\n\r\n- You can consider to assign this issue to me to make the site accessible for screen readers\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshot (Going to make changes on these elements)\r\n![image](https://github.com/MonalikaPatnaik/UMatter/assets/92252895/489f95c3-c662-437c-bcaa-b3c7d8730247)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have checked the existing issues\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n- [X] I am willing to work on this issue\r\n- [X] I am a GSSoC'23 contributor\r\n\r\n----",

                        "description": "**Issue Description:**\r\nAs an active contributor to your open-source project, I believe that implementing an auto-comment feature would greatly enhance collaboration and communication within the project. This feature would automatically generate comments in response to specific events, such as when an issue is opened, a pull request is created, an issue is assigned, or an issue is unassigned.\r\n\r\n**Feature Details:**\r\n- When an issue is opened, the auto-comment should greet the author and provide a brief acknowledgement and request for additional context.\r\n- When a pull request is opened, the auto-comment should greet the author, express gratitude, and remind them to follow the project's contributing guidelines.\r\n- When an issue is closed, the auto-comment should thank the author for their contribution and encourage further engagement.\r\n- When an issue is assigned to someone, the auto-comment should notify the assignee and encourage them to start working on it.\r\n- When an issue is unassigned from someone, the auto-comment should notify the assignee about the change and suggest reassignment if they are offline.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Improved communication and engagement with contributors.\r\n- Provides clear instructions and acknowledgements for various events.\r\n- Enhances collaboration by setting expectations and providing reminders.\r\n- Reduces manual effort by automating comment generation.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The auto-comment feature should be implemented using the \"wow-actions/auto-comment\" GitHub Action.\r\n- Comments should be appropriately customized for each event, mentioning relevant parties and providing the necessary information.\r\n- The auto-comment workflow should trigger on the following events: issues opened, pull requests opened, issues closed, issues assigned, and issues unassigned.\r\n- The feature should be added to the project's existing GitHub Actions workflow file.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\nFeel free to ask any questions or seek clarification regarding the auto-comment feature. I'm excited about contributing to your project and believe this enhancement will greatly benefit its community.\r\n\r\n",

                        "description": "**Describe the bug**\r\nThere is a usability issue with the \"Get Started\" button on the About page. Currently, when clicked, the button redirects users to the home page, which already contains a \"Get Started\" button that further redirects users to the sign-in page. This redundancy and confusion in the user flow need to be addressed.\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\n**Problem Description:**\r\nThe current redirection of the \"Get Started\" button on the About page creates a redundant user experience. Users are directed to the home page, where they encounter another \"Get Started\" button that leads to the sign-in page. This unnecessary redirection adds confusion and may deter users from efficiently accessing the sign-in page.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\nTo improve the user experience and eliminate redundancy: \r\n\r\n1. Directly redirect users to the sign-in page: The code associated with the \"Get Started\" button on the About page can be modified to directly redirect users to the sign-in page. This approach eliminates the extra step of navigating to the home page and subsequently clicking the \"Get Started\" button again.\r\n\r\n2. Renaming the button for clarity: If the \"Get Started\" button on the About page is intended to serve a different purpose than the one on the home page, consider renaming it to reflect its specific function. For example, it could be renamed to \"Learn More\" or \"Explore Features\" to provide a clearer indication of the action users will take when clicking the button.\r\n\r\n**Screen recording of the problem**\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MonalikaPatnaik/UMatter/assets/62384655/163e42c1-bbfa-4116-ae19-0938750c1f73\r\n",

Currently, when the navbar is opened and an option is clicked, it does not automatically close. The user has to manually click the navbar button again to close it. Additionally, when the \"home\" button is clicked, the navbar still overlays the hero section, causing a visual overlap.\n\nThis issue affects the usability and user experience of the website on smaller and medium screens. To provide a better user experience, it would be ideal for the navbar to automatically close after selecting an option. Furthermore, the navbar should not overlay the hero section when the \"home\" button is clicked.\n\n**Labels:** bug, enhancement\n",

                        "description": "The website requires several enhancements to improve the overall user experience and visual aesthetics. The following issues have been identified:\r\n\r\n1. Dark Mode Inconsistency:\r\nThe dark mode feature is only functioning properly in the navbar, but it should be extended to other sections of the website as well. Ensure that the dark mode theme is applied consistently throughout all pages.\r\n\r\n2. Link Colors and Animation:\r\nThe current link colors lack visual appeal and may not provide enough contrast against the background. Consider improving the link colors to enhance readability. Additionally, introduce a subtle animation effect, such as color transition or underline, to indicate interactivity when hovering over the links.\r\n\r\n3. Active Link Highlight:\r\nWhen navigating through the website, it's important to visually highlight the active link to provide clear feedback to the user. Implement a distinct visual cue, such as a different color or underline, to indicate the currently active page or section.\r\n\r\n4. Sign-In Button Improvement:\r\nThe design of the sign-in button needs enhancement. It should be visually appealing and easily noticeable. Consider using a different color, style, or placement to make it stand out and encourage users to sign in.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution:\r\nTo address these issues and improve the website:\r\n\r\n1. Extend the dark mode feature to all sections of the website, ensuring consistency across pages.\r\n\r\n2. Improve the link colors to enhance readability and introduce a subtle animation effect to indicate interactivity.\r\n\r\n3. Implement a visual cue to highlight the active link, such as a different color or underline, to provide clear feedback to users.\r\n\r\n4. Enhance the design of the sign-in button to make it visually appealing and encourage user engagement.\r\n",

                        "description": "### Description\r\nWhen accessing the site on a mobile device, there is a horizontal scroll that allows scrolling from left to right. This issue occurs when the elements in the UI do not adjust properly to the mobile viewport, resulting in an inconvenient user experience.\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\nThe main goal of this issue is to improve the responsiveness of the UI for mobile devices. By fixing this issue, mobile users will be able to access the site without any horizontal scrolling or layout issues.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\nTo address this issue, the following steps could be considered:\r\n\r\n1. Identify the elements or components causing the horizontal scrolling issue. Review the styling applied using styled-components, focusing on width-related properties.\r\n2. Adjust the width or responsiveness of the elements to ensure they fit within the mobile viewport without causing horizontal scrolling.\r\n3. Test the changes across different mobile devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent and responsive experience.\r\n\r\nOptionally, including an image of the site on a mobile screen could provide additional visual context for the issue.\r\n\r\n### Contribution and Availability\r\nI am available to fix this issue as part of my contribution to the GirlScript Summer of Code 2023 program. Kindly assign this issue to me so that I can start working on it.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any other specific considerations or requirements for this issue.\r\n",

GET request do't have body hence the data intered by user will be sent to the server using path parameters or query parameters which is heighly unsecure way to send data to server. i can make the sign in process more secure as well as proper in will send all the informations in encryped format using an npm packege (bcrypt). the sensative data (like password and email) will be send to server in the form of JSON object to the server and in body of post request and hence will not be visible in URL and that too in encrypted form. \r\n\r\nin this way the whole sign in process will be heighly secure. i will implement this to sign up page also because both sign in and sign up pages will have to access same data base. i will integrate \"sqlite data base\" using npm pakeges like \"sqlite\" and \r\n\"sqlite3\" hence data entered will be saved in server that too in encrypted format and can be verified at the time of sign in process. \r\n\r\nwhen the server will receave sign in request server will generate a personal access token to user in body of response through which user will not have to enter password again untill and unless the token is expired. \r\n\r\nbasically i wanted to conclude with last words which are, i will transform login and sign up system of this website which is nearly nothing in site currently. \r\n\r\ni am attaching the screen short of sign in attempt which i have made and screen shot of header of request made which is proving that request make is a GET request. this login and sign up system is at a very nascent stage, needs to improve alot in which i can realy support organisation. please assign under GSSoC'23.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-05-21 17-45-07](https://github.com/MonalikaPatnaik/UMatter/assets/97947258/80b5a2ac-80d8-4393-a4b5-6015d23cfed9)\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-05-21 17-47-37](https://github.com/MonalikaPatnaik/UMatter/assets/97947258/4e37da84-596b-43f3-aa52-4806228a0969)\r\n",

Currently, the cursor remains in its default state, indicating that the button is not interactive.\r\n\r\n**Observation**:\r\nUpon investigating the issue, I noticed that the cursor does not change when hovering over the \"Get Started\" button. This behavior is inconsistent with user expectations and may lead to confusion or frustration.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**:\r\nTo address this issue, I suggest adding the CSS property cursor: \"pointer\" to the style definition of the \"Get Started\" button. This will change the cursor to a pointer icon, indicating that the button is clickable and interactive.\r\n\r\n**Visual Representation**:\r\nHere is a comparison of the button's appearance before and after implementing the suggested CSS property:\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore ⤵️ \r\n\r\n![change 1](https://github.com/MonalikaPatnaik/UMatter/assets/103810119/da4c0e06-5ff2-499e-a782-9f585d346d0d)\r\n\r\n \r\n**After** ⤵️ \r\n\r\n![change1 after](https://github.com/MonalikaPatnaik/UMatter/assets/103810119/5f8d1345-20e4-4e76-854b-15b611bedb83)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Can you please assign this issue to me? if you think it's important so that I can resolve it?\r\n",

This means that, when the new issue is created, it will be locked. The issue will be unlocked when the maintainer/admin will add `status: ready for dev` label to it. The admins and maintainers would greatly benefit from this, and it would also reduce notifications.\r\n\r\n**Record**\r\n- [x] I agree to follow project's contribution guidelines and code of conduct.\r\n- [x] I'm a GSSoC'23 contributor.\r\n- [x] I want to work on this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",

This leads to difficulties in maintaining data integrity and can cause issues throughout the application.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nIntegrate JOI schema validator into the system to enhance data validation capabilities. JOI is a powerful validation library for JavaScript that provides a declarative way to define data validation rules. By incorporating JOI, we can easily define and enforce data validation rules, ensuring that data entered into the system meets the required criteria.\r\n\r\nThere are various other alternatives that are considered:\r\n1.) Roll our own validation solution: Developing a custom validation solution would be time-consuming and error-prone. It would require significant effort to handle various validation scenarios effectively.\r\n\r\n2.) Use other existing validation libraries: While there are other validation libraries available, JOI stands out due to its extensive features, flexibility, and widespread adoption. It provides a rich set of validation rules and allows for complex validations with ease.\r\n\r\nWithout a proper data validation mechanism, the system is prone to accepting invalid or inconsistent data. This can lead to issues such as corrupted data, application crashes, and incorrect processing. By adding a JOI schema validator, we can ensure that data entered into the system adheres to the defined validation rules, improving overall data quality and system reliability.\r\n\r\nI am eager to formally contribute to this issue, utilizing my expertise and skills to provide valuable insights and potential solutions.",

This feature would automatically generate comments in response to specific events, such as when an issue is opened, a pull request is created, an issue is assigned, or an issue is unassigned.\r\n\r\n**Feature Details:**\r\n- When an issue is opened, the auto-comment should greet the author and provide a brief acknowledgement and request for additional context.\r\n- When a pull request is opened, the auto-comment should greet the author, express gratitude, and remind them to follow the project's contributing guidelines.\r\n- When an issue is closed, the auto-comment should thank the author for their contribution and encourage further engagement.\r\n- When an issue is assigned to someone, the auto-comment should notify the assignee and encourage them to start working on it.\r\n- When an issue is unassigned from someone, the auto-comment should notify the assignee about the change and suggest reassignment if they are offline.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Improved communication and engagement with contributors.\r\n- Provides clear instructions and acknowledgements for various events.\r\n- Enhances collaboration by setting expectations and providing reminders.\r\n- Reduces manual effort by automating comment generation.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The auto-comment feature should be implemented using the \"wow-actions/auto-comment\" GitHub Action.\r\n- Comments should be appropriately customized for each event, mentioning relevant parties and providing the necessary information.\r\n- The auto-comment workflow should trigger on the following events: issues opened, pull requests opened, issues closed, issues assigned, and issues unassigned.\r\n- The feature should be added to the project's existing GitHub Actions workflow file.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\nFeel free to ask any questions or seek clarification regarding the auto-comment feature. I'm excited about contributing to your project and believe this enhancement will greatly benefit its community.\r\n\r\n",

This could involve restructuring the existing codebase, creating a new startup script, or implementing a configuration file that consolidates all the necessary settings.\r\n\r\nLet's discuss and brainstorm ideas on how we can achieve this goal, and work towards a more streamlined and efficient server setup process.

Currently, the Hero section does not adapt optimally to different screen sizes, resulting in suboptimal user experiences on certain devices or viewport sizes.\r\n\r\nNote: It is important to refer to our contribution guidelines to align with the project's standards and ensure a smooth collaboration process.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your valuable contributions in improving the responsiveness of the Hero section. Let's create an outstanding user experience together! If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to reach out. Happy coding!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"307\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/Stoccoin-Official/Stoccoin-Website/assets/115306535/f207f347-3a7e-4097-b98f-99bd97246640\">\r\n\r\n",

This is one of the most authentic way to authenticate user\r\n2. It will be very convenient for regular users use who don't have account in GitHub/Gitlab/ Bitbucket \r\n3. It is reliable and secure\r\n4. Most of the users trust on google\r\n5. It fast and responsive\r\n\r\nApproach:\r\nTo add this feature, I propose the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. To implement this feature we will use  Passport which is authentication middleware for Node.js\r\n6. We will setup passport google oauth2 strategy\r\n7. We will generate a OAuth client id \r\n8. then verify the user using Google Account \r\n9. Save the user data into database \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n\r\nAs a proud participant of GSSOC3, armed with my extensive experience in similar projects, I possess the unwavering confidence to skillfully incorporate this feature .\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my involvement in resolving this issue.

The functionalities affected include Book Search, Google Book Viewer, and Google Login.\r\n\r\nFunctionalities Affected:\r\n1. **Book Search**: The Book Search feature, which allowed users to search for books based on various criteria, is no longer available on the website.\r\n\r\n2. **Google Book Viewer**: The Google Book Viewer, which provided a seamless way for users to preview books before making a decision, is no longer accessible.\r\n\r\n3. **Google Login**: The integration of Google Login that enabled users to sign in using their Google accounts has been removed, resulting in a less user-friendly authentication process.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact:\r\nThe removal of these functionalities significantly impacts the user experience and may lead to decreased user engagement on the platform. As these features were highly appreciated by our community members, it is crucial to address this issue urgently to retain our users and maintain the website's functionality.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution:\r\nI will take immediate action to restore the Book Search, Google Book Viewer, and Google Login functionalities. The proposed solution includes the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Reimplement Book Search**: I will reinstate the Book Search feature, ensuring that users can search for books by title, author, genre, or any other relevant criteria.\r\n\r\n2. **Restore Google Book Viewer**: I will reintegrate the Google Book Viewer to allow users to preview book content directly on the website.\r\n\r\n3. **Reestablish Google Login**: The Google Login functionality will be reinstated, providing users with a seamless and secure sign-in process using their Google accounts.\r\n\r\nNext Steps:\r\n1. Identify the cause of the functionalities' removal during the Next.js migration.\r\n2. Implement the necessary changes to restore the Book Search, Google Book Viewer, and Google Login features.\r\n3. Perform thorough testing to ensure the proper functioning and security of the reinstated functionalities.\r\n4. Create a pull request for review and testing by the team.\r\n5. Once approved, merge the changes into the main codebase and deploy the updated version to the live site.\r\n\r\nI understand the urgency of this issue and will work promptly to fix it and restore the essential functionalities for our users. Feedback and collaboration from the team are highly appreciated to ensure the best possible outcome.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any additional information?\n\n@rohansx @crocmons   ,please assign me this issue,it is very cruical issue for informaticon website ,i will fix it asap \n\n### What browser are you seeing the problem on?\n\nMicrosoft Edge\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [X] I have checked the existing issues\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/rupali-codes/LinksHub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [X] I have read the discussion tab thoroughly and got the project idea\n- [X] I am willing to work on this issue (optional)\n- [X] I am a GSSoC'23 contributor",

Clicking on the button should initiate the Google login process and allow users to log in with their Google accounts.\r\n\r\n**Current Behavior:**\r\nThe \"Login with Google\" button remains disabled until the user fulfills the validation requirements for the email and password fields. As a result, users cannot proceed with the Google login process without entering the required information.\r\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rohansx/informatician/assets/85815172/34c43347-8121-49a7-9eba-9ba09f1588a0\r\n\r\n\n\n### Any additional information?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What browser are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [X] I have checked the existing issues\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/rupali-codes/LinksHub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [X] I have read the discussion tab thoroughly and got the project idea\n- [X] I am willing to work on this issue (optional)\n- [X] I am a GSSoC'23 contributor",

This poses a significant security risk, as anyone with access to the codebase can potentially misuse this information and compromise the application's security. 😱🚨\r\n\r\nTo enhance security and protect sensitive information, we need to refactor the code and move the server hosted link to the .env file. By doing so, the link will be hidden from the project's source code, and only authorized personnel with access to the .env file will be able to see and modify it. 🙅‍♂️💻🔐\r\n\r\nThis change will significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and unauthorized access to critical endpoints, ensuring the application remains secure and protected from potential threats. 🚀🔒\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![image](https://github.com/rohansx/informatician/assets/85815172/2d6e929d-a269-4908-8fec-ec5ef2c57c32)\r\n\n\n### Any additional information?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What browser are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [X] I have checked the existing issues\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/rupali-codes/LinksHub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [X] I have read the discussion tab thoroughly and got the project idea\n- [X] I am willing to work on this issue (optional)\n- [X] I am a GSSoC'23 contributor",

This feature would automatically generate comments in response to specific events, such as when an issue is opened, a pull request is created, an issue is assigned, or an issue is unassigned.\r\n\r\n**Feature Details:**\r\n- When an issue is opened, the auto-comment should greet the author and provide a brief acknowledgement and request for additional context.\r\n- When a pull request is opened, the auto-comment should greet the author, express gratitude, and remind them to follow the project's contributing guidelines.\r\n- When an issue is closed, the auto-comment should thank the author for their contribution and encourage further engagement.\r\n- When an issue is assigned to someone, the auto-comment should notify the assignee and encourage them to start working on it.\r\n- When an issue is unassigned from someone, the auto-comment should notify the assignee about the change and suggest reassignment if they are offline.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Improved communication and engagement with contributors.\r\n- Provides clear instructions and acknowledgements for various events.\r\n- Enhances collaboration by setting expectations and providing reminders.\r\n- Reduces manual effort by automating comment generation.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The auto-comment feature should be implemented using the \"wow-actions/auto-comment\" GitHub Action.\r\n- Comments should be appropriately customized for each event, mentioning relevant parties and providing the necessary information.\r\n- The auto-comment workflow should trigger on the following events: issues opened, pull requests opened, issues closed, issues assigned, and issues unassigned.\r\n- The feature should be added to the project's existing GitHub Actions workflow file.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\nFeel free to ask any questions or seek clarification regarding the auto-comment feature. I'm excited about contributing to your project and believe this enhancement will greatly benefit its community.\r\n\r\n",

That's a shame, I'd love to see how it works.\r\n\r\nWhen I create a new site via Quiqr (from scratch only), it shows up in the site library but immediately shows an error message \"Hugo installation failed. Please contact your developer\". The error message then shows up every time Quiqr loads the \"Content\" page for the site.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to create a new site from a Hugo theme, the website is not created at all. The \"site has been successfully newed\" (I'm newing!) window shows up, but the website does not appears in the site library, nor in the quiqr\\sites folder.\r\n\r\nI've tried with and without a Hugo installation on my system, rebooted everything but the issues persists.\r\nI'm using Windows 11, latest update, 64 bits.",

This is because Better Strongholds uses its own loot tables in place of the stronghold library rooms, and Hex Casting only injects to the vanilla stronghold library loot table. Simple fix would be to add other loot tables for these scrolls to spawn in `betterstrongholds:chests/grand_library` and `betterstrongholds:chests/library_md` (can be done in hex casting server config)\r\n",

Typically the mobs have been the mobs for The Graveyard and Probably Chests Mimics. \r\n\r\nThe probably chests mimics will spawn around an individual player frequently and are unkillable. Say if 4 people are online only 1 will have the mimics spawn around them.\r\n\r\nThe Graveyard enemies are less frequent, and don't spawn around an individual player. But otherwise the same problem, nobody is able to hurt them.\r\n\r\nWe have been trying to troubleshoot for the last few days to try and find the source of this issue, thinking maybe a mod we've interacted with is causing it like the Luggage issue I found before.

I think this is an Aeternum map issue, not a Skeleton issue, because Skeleton hasn't been updated in several months, but the Aeternum map site has been rather frequently updated over the past few days. One change to the site could have broken this functionality, but I don't know enough to be sure. What's odd is that navigating to the minimap site in my usual browser shows the map without issues. Only Skeleton seems to be showing nothing when I go there.\r\n\r\nI usually enable the minimap to display in the upper left of my screen, always on top with click-through and transparency. I also set the border size to none, so it appears square. Still, ever since this afternoon, when I reloaded that Skeleton window, it hasn't worked at all. It's completely invisible, and the task view only shows an empty app window when I alt-tab through my open apps. I tried mousing over the area where it should be to somehow cause it to fade back into view. I tried pressing my display/hide hotkey in Skeleton. I tried rebooting my system. I tried toggling the minimap window on and off several times, along with its companion window with the full map and settings. Nothing has worked to make the minimap site as visible as it once was.\r\n\r\nIs this it? Did AGS call for this function to be shut down from the site-side app? Or does something in the Skeleton app need to change?",

I'd like to bring to your attention an incompatibility issue I've noticed with the night mode feature in your repository. While the night mode itself works great, there seems to be a problem with the display of cards on both the Guide and Schedule pages.\r\n\r\nWhen the night mode is enabled, the cards on these pages appear to have insufficient contrast or inappropriate styling, making them difficult to read or distinguish from one another. This significantly hinders the overall user experience, especially for those who rely on the night mode for accessibility or personal preference reasons.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, I suggest reviewing the styles applied to the cards on the Guide and Schedule pages when the night mode is active. Consider adjusting the text color, background color, or any other relevant styling properties to ensure better visibility and readability.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

                        "description": "It looks like Chrome is prefetching (I think with `onBeforeNavigate`) the DID information when a URL is being entered into a new tab. This sounds like desired functionality from a performance perspective, but it appears to create a bug in the extension on Chrome.\r\n\r\nThe general flow for web page loading looks like this: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118477/236666844-b2226a1e-e11d-46fd-8a5e-1dabfab197c4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI tested this using my latest fork, but I also confirmed it is present in `1.1.0` on the web store. \r\n\r\n### To reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. On the new tab page type in a URL that will return a DID (e.g. `https://washingtonpost.com`), but don't press enter yet. \r\n2. As soon as Chrome knows enough about the URL, the icon will turn blue.\r\n  a. This occurs when the complete URL is typed, or a previously visited URL is auto-completed.\r\n3. Press enter to visit the URL - the page loads and the icon turns gray when it should still be blue (bug).\r\n4. Reload the page and it turns blue (normal behavior).\r\n\r\n### Before Loading:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"698\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118477/236666309-de32e27b-9856-4263-9ede-88a283bf83a9.png\">\r\n\r\n### After Loading (bugged):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"692\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118477/236666338-76db0e8a-3c47-4329-bfb2-fac6185b19ad.png\">\r\n\r\n### After Reload (working):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"695\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118477/236666395-0c62c4c7-eb84-49b8-bce5-f0a109a073ca.png\">\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen when entering a URL on an already loaded web page, only the new tab page\r\n\r\nThis behavior does not appear in Firefox or Firefox nightly, as it appears they don't implement the same prefetching on the new tab page.\r\n\r\n### Potential Solutions\r\n\r\n1. Find a way to preserve the state (blue icon) between the prefetch detection and the first page load. e.g. in the example above, the icon would remain blue in all 3 screenshot states. With a cursory glance, I'm unsure of the level of effort or how to go about this, but it's probably the best solution.\r\n2. Add the `webNavigation` permission to the manifests and edit `content.js` so the extension waits until the `onCommitted` state is hit. Unfortunately I haven't figured out a way to get this working yet and it's also undesirable permission scope creep. \r\n\r\nOpen to any ideas others may have, and I'll take a look with fresh eyes tomorrow. 😴",

Maybe we can use this issue to synchronize on the matter.

Just to understand the code better, I am trying to improve the snapToPad to return a reference, and I have some thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe way I thought could work would be from withing the `snapToPad` function. \r\n\r\n1. When a pad is hit, one grabs the identifier of the component and tries to find where it is referenced in the codemirror editor.\r\n2. If a variable referencing it is found, construction of the reference to be inserted becomes easy and it can be considered done.\r\n3. If a variable is not found, it is possible to prefix the line `board.add(\"comp...\")` with a variable such as `let comp1 = `. No problem.\r\n\r\nSo far so clear, but what makes it challenging is that the initial component definitions do not have a name or ID. So I wonder, maybe it makes sense to generate a random one on the fly. \r\n\r\nOK, this is something I realized while writing this and will try, but maybe there is something I am missing.",
